TaskRef: "Fix GitHub Pages deployment build failure for Next.js project"

Learnings:
- Next.js `output: 'export'` (often implied by `GITHUB_PAGES: true` env var during GitHub Pages builds) fails when encountering API routes. The error message can be `Error: export const dynamic = "force-static"/export const revalidate not configured on route "/api/..." with "output: export"`.
- Adding `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';` to the API route handler (e.g., `app/api/.../route.ts`) is a way to declare its dynamic nature to Next.js.
- The fundamental issue is that API routes require a server, and `output: 'export'` aims to produce serverless static assets. If an API route is essential, `output: 'export'` might not be suitable, or the route needs to be handled differently (e.g., moved to a separate serverfull deployment, or conditionally excluded if not needed for the static site).

Difficulties:
- The `next.config.mjs` file did not explicitly contain `output: 'export'`, making it clear this configuration was likely being applied by the build environment (GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages).

Successes:
- Correctly interpreted the Next.js build error log.
- Identified the problematic API route (`/api/debug`).
- Applied a relevant Next.js segment configuration option (`export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';`) to the API route handler.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: For Next.js `output: 'export'` build failures on API routes, first attempt to add `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';` to the route handler file.
- If the build still fails, the API route is likely incompatible with a pure static export and may need to be removed from the static build path or the application re-architected for static deployment if the API is critical.
- Note: The `GITHUB_PAGES: true` environment variable is a strong indicator that Next.js will attempt a static export (`output: 'export'`).
