TaskRef: "Investigate and Fix High Volume of Failed Supabase Requests"

Learnings:
- Identified that including a state variable in the dependency array of a `useEffect` that also sets that same state variable can cause an infinite loop of requests. This was the root cause of the `400 Bad Request` errors on the `GET /rest/v1/users_teams` endpoint.
- Realized that `409 Conflict` errors on `POST` requests can be caused by race conditions on the client-side, especially when the client is responsible for optimistic UI updates and direct database insertions.
- A simple but effective way to prevent race conditions from user input is to disable the submission button while a request is in progress.

Difficulties:
- Initially, it was unclear whether the `409 Conflict` errors were originating from the client or server. A thorough review of the API routes was necessary to confirm that the client was directly inserting messages into the database.

Successes:
- Successfully identified and resolved two distinct issues causing a high volume of failed requests.
- The fix for the `400 Bad Request` errors was a simple one-line change that will significantly reduce the number of unnecessary requests.
- The fix for the `409 Conflict` errors will improve the user experience by preventing accidental duplicate message submissions.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When debugging high-volume request issues, always check for infinite loops in `useEffect` hooks.
- General pattern: When encountering `409 Conflict` errors, investigate the client-side code for potential race conditions, especially if the client is performing optimistic updates.
