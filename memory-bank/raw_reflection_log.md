TaskRef: "Identify and create Supabase SQL tables based on application codebase analysis."

Learnings:
- Identified that `chat_sessions`, `chat_messages`, and `projects` data were being managed client-side via Zustand and localStorage (`lib/stores/chat-sidebar-stores.ts`, `lib/types/chat-sidebar.ts`). This was a key finding that shifted the focus for these tables from "what exists" to "what needs to be created for backend persistence."
- Confirmed `profiles` table is actively used via `app/actions/profile.ts`.
- Inferred `user_api_keys` table from `app/settings/api-keys/page.tsx` (though UI is placeholder).
- Discovered that team functionality (`UserTeam` in `lib/auth.ts`) is currently mocked client-side and does not involve actual `teams` or `team_members` Supabase tables. This avoided creating unnecessary tables for now but highlighted a potential future extension.
- Noted discrepancy in `ChatMessage` content structure: `lib/types/chat-sidebar.ts` shows simple string, while `app/page.tsx` implies a richer JSON structure. Opted for JSONB in the `chat_messages` table for flexibility.
- Successfully created a comprehensive SQL migration file (`supabase/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql`) including table definitions, `updated_at` triggers, RLS policies, and indexes.
- Importance of `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for tables that might partially exist (like `profiles`).
- Standard practice of creating a `handle_new_user` trigger on `auth.users` to populate the `profiles` table.

Difficulties:
- Initial assumption that `userTeam` implied existing backend tables for teams. Reading `lib/auth.ts` clarified this was a client-side mock.
- Reconciling different `Message` / `ChatMessage` structures. Decided to go with the more comprehensive structure for backend storage.

Successes:
- Thorough analysis of multiple files (pages, components, actions, types, stores) to build a complete picture.
- Correctly identifying which data was client-side vs. server-side.
- Producing a detailed and robust SQL schema with RLS and common database practices.
