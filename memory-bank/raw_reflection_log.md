TaskRef: "Correct rainbow effects for enhanced chat input (continuous border, focus glow, no hover glow)"

Learnings:
- Encountered an issue where `components/rainbow-animations.css` was unexpectedly reverted, causing `replace_in_file` to fail. Used `write_to_file` to restore and correct the CSS.
- Removed Tailwind's generic `border` class from the chat input `div` in `enhanced-chat-input.tsx` to prevent conflicts with the `rainbow-border` animation.
- Refactored CSS for `.rainbow-chat-input::before` and `::after` to have a base definition (initially hidden) and then activate/animate them specifically for `:focus-within`. This decouples the focus glow from any hover styles.
- Ensured hover-specific styles for `.rainbow-chat-input` were completely removed.

Difficulties:
- The CSS file being reverted to an old state was unexpected and required a full rewrite of the file instead of a targeted replacement.

Successes:
- Successfully used `write_to_file` to restore the CSS to the intended state with the correct effects.
- The chat input should now have a continuous rainbow border, a glow effect on focus, and no specific glow effect on hover.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- When `replace_in_file` fails due to unexpected file content changes (like a revert), `write_to_file` is a reliable fallback to ensure the desired state.
- Importance of defining base states for pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) if they are conditionally made visible by different pseudo-classes (like `:focus-within`) to avoid dependencies on other states (like `:hover`).
- Removing conflicting base CSS classes (like Tailwind's `border`) when a custom animated border is intended.

TaskRef: "Update rainbow colors to gradient in components/rainbow-animations.css"

Learnings:
- The `replace_in_file` tool requires exact matches for its SEARCH blocks. Incomplete or malformed REPLACE blocks, especially for multi-line CSS rules, will cause failures.
- When `replace_in_file` fails repeatedly (e.g., 3 times as per guidelines) or for complex modifications in a relatively small file, `write_to_file` is a more robust and reliable method to apply the changes.
- To create an animated gradient border:
    - Use a transparent `border-color` (e.g., `border: 2px solid transparent;`).
    - Apply a `linear-gradient` to the `background-image` property.
    - Set `background-size` to a larger dimension (e.g., `400% 400%`) to allow the gradient to move.
    - Animate the `background-position` property in `@keyframes`.
    - `background-origin: border-box;` ensures the background starts from the outer edge of the border.
    - `background-clip: padding-box, border-box;` (or just `background-clip: border-box;` if no other content background is needed) makes the gradient visible as the border. The first value clips the main background, the second clips the background extended to the border.
- Keyframes for `background-position` can be simplified if only that property is being animated, removing other properties like `border-color` if they are no longer part of the animated effect.

Difficulties:
- Initial `replace_in_file` attempts failed due to incomplete `REPLACE` sections for the CSS rules being modified. The tool's error messages about `SEARCH` block mismatches can sometimes mask issues in the `REPLACE` block or the overall structure of the diff.
- Ensuring all necessary CSS properties (`background-origin`, `background-clip`) were correctly included for the gradient border effect.

Successes:
- Successfully transformed the static color-step rainbow border into a smooth, animated gradient border.
- The `write_to_file` tool was effective in applying the final, correct CSS after `replace_in_file` proved problematic for this specific set of changes.
- The animation timing and general visual behavior of the rainbow effect were preserved by adapting the existing `background-position` keyframes.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- For CSS gradient borders: `border: Xpx solid transparent; background-image: linear-gradient(...); background-origin: border-box; background-clip: border-box;` (or `padding-box, border-box`). Animate `background-position`.
- If `replace_in_file` fails multiple times, especially on complex multi-line replacements, switch to `write_to_file` sooner to save steps, particularly if the file isn't excessively large.
