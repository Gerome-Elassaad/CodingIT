# Feature Flags Performance Optimization

## Problem Solved
The application was repeatedly showing warnings about Edge Config not being configured and making redundant API calls to GrowthBook, causing:
- Console spam with repetitive warning messages
- Unnecessary API calls on every feature flag check
- Slower response times due to network requests

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Caching System**
- Added in-memory caching with configurable timeout (5 minutes production, 15 minutes development)
- Prevents redundant API calls during the cache period
- Automatically refreshes when cache expires

### 2. **Reduced Console Spam**
- Warnings now only appear once per cache period instead of on every request
- Cleaner development experience with fewer repetitive logs
- Maintains important error visibility without spam

### 3. **Environment-Aware Configuration**
- Longer cache timeout in development (15 minutes) to reduce API calls during development
- Production optimized with 5-minute cache for real-time updates
- Graceful fallback to mock data when external services are unavailable

## Configuration Options

### Option 1: No Configuration (Default)
- Uses mock feature flags with local caching
- No external dependencies
- Perfect for development and testing
- Zero API calls after initial cache

### Option 2: GrowthBook API Only
```env
GROWTHBOOK_CLIENT_KEY="sdk-your-client-key"
GROWTHBOOK_API_ENDPOINT="https://api.growthbook.io/api/features/your-key"
```

### Option 3: Full Edge Config (Recommended for Production)
```env
EDGE_CONFIG="https://edge-config.vercel.app/ecfg_your_id"
GROWTHBOOK_CLIENT_KEY="sdk-your-client-key"
GROWTHBOOK_API_ENDPOINT="https://api.growthbook.io/api/features/your-key"
```

## Performance Improvements

### Before:
- üîÑ API call on every feature flag check
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Repeated console warnings
- üêå Network latency on each request
- üìà High API usage

### After:
- ‚úÖ Cached responses (5-15 minute cache)
- üîá Reduced console spam (once per cache period)
- ‚ö° Fast local cache responses
- üìâ Minimal API usage

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Feature flags now load from cache instead of API
2. **Cost**: Reduced API calls to GrowthBook (saves on usage limits)
3. **Reliability**: Works offline with cached/mock data
4. **Developer Experience**: Cleaner console output during development
5. **Scalability**: Can handle high traffic without hitting API limits

## File Changes Made

- `lib/edge-config-adapter.ts`: Enhanced with caching and reduced logging
- `.env.example`: Added configuration documentation
- `docs/FEATURE_FLAGS_OPTIMIZATION.md`: This documentation

## Default Mock Features

When no external configuration is provided, the system uses these mock feature flags:
- `workflow-builder-v2`: false
- `enhanced-code-editor`: false  
- `premium-templates`: false
- `advanced-analytics`: false
- `beta-ai-models`: false
- `theme-customization`: false
- `subscription-tier`: "free"

These can be easily modified in the `getMockFeatureData()` method in `lib/edge-config-adapter.ts`.
