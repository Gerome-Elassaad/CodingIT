TaskRef: "Fix preview to use E2B template servers"

Learnings:
- Modified `components/preview.tsx` to correctly display live previews from E2B template servers.
  - Renamed the "Fragment" tab to "Preview".
  - Changed the `selectedTab` state and prop types from `'code' | 'fragment'` to `'code' | 'preview'` in `components/preview.tsx` and `app/page.tsx`.
  - The "Preview" tab now uses the `FragmentWeb` component (imported from `./fragment-web.tsx`) to render the E2B URL when `result.template` is not `'code-interpreter-v1'`.
  - Used the `Globe` icon for the "Preview" tab.
  - Updated `app/page.tsx` to set `currentTab` to `"preview"` when a sandbox with a URL is successfully created, otherwise to `"code"`.
- Corrected import paths:
  - Ensured `FragmentWeb` is imported from `./fragment-web.tsx` in `components/preview.tsx`.
- Refined type handling for discriminated unions:
  - Simplified the conditional logic in `components/fragment-preview.tsx` for `ExecutionResult` to use a direct `if/else` based on `result.template === 'code-interpreter-v1'`, which helped TypeScript correctly infer types for `FragmentInterpreter` and `FragmentWeb` props. This resolved a persistent TypeScript error about type overlap.

Difficulties:
- Encountered several TypeScript errors related to type mismatches (`'fragment'` vs `'preview'`) and incorrect module exports/imports (`FragmentWeb`).
- A persistent TypeScript error in `components/fragment-preview.tsx` regarding type overlap in a conditional statement required careful refactoring of the discriminated union handling.

Successes:
- Successfully refactored the preview logic to integrate E2B template server previews.
- Resolved all TypeScript errors through iterative changes and careful attention to import paths and type definitions.
- The `replace_in_file` tool was used effectively for targeted modifications across multiple files.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Pattern: Handling discriminated unions in TypeScript. A simple `if/else` structure is often best for type narrowing.
- Pattern: Updating UI components and their corresponding state management when renaming features or changing underlying data types (e.g., tab names and associated state values).
- Debugging: When a component is not exported/imported correctly, TypeScript errors will often point to the consuming file first (`Module X declares Y locally, but it is not exported`). Always check the source file of Y for the actual export.
- Project Specifics: `components/preview.tsx` handles the main preview tabs. `app/page.tsx` manages the state for which tab is active. `components/fragment-preview.tsx` contains `FragmentPreview` (which decides between interpreter/web view) and `FileTreeCodeViewer`. `components/fragment-web.tsx` contains the iframe logic for E2B.
