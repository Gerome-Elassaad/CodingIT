TaskRef: "Fix TS errors in lib/prompts/analyzers/index.ts"

Learnings:
- The `replace_in_file` tool's `SEARCH` block requires an exact match. If it fails, the tool provides the current file content, which is critical to use as the source of truth for the next attempt. This avoids errors from stale context.
- When refactoring a function signature (e.g., removing a parameter), it is crucial to find and update all call sites for that function. Missing this step will lead to compiler errors, as seen with the `Expected 1 arguments, but got 2` error.
- Systematically addressing each linter/compiler hint one by one is a very effective strategy for debugging and cleaning up a file.

Difficulties:
- My first attempt to use `replace_in_file` failed because my `SEARCH` block did not match the actual file content. The path in the import statement was different (`@/lib/templates` vs what I had).

Successes:
- Successfully identified and fixed multiple distinct TypeScript errors, including unused variables, unused imports, and incorrect function arguments.
- Correctly used the `replace_in_file` tool on the second attempt after receiving updated file content.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General Pattern: When a `replace_in_file` operation fails due to a mismatch, immediately use the provided file content from the error message to construct the next attempt.
- General Pattern: When changing a function's signature, immediately search for its usages to update all calls, preventing follow-up errors.

TaskRef: "Fix terminal feature due to Node.js version mismatch"

Learnings:
- The E2B sandbox environment is defined by a Dockerfile.
- `EBADENGINE` errors from npm indicate a Node.js version incompatibility.
- The fix is to update the `FROM` instruction in the relevant `e2b.Dockerfile` to a compatible Node.js version.

Difficulties:
- None. The error message clearly indicated the problem and the file structure pointed to the likely location of the fix.

Successes:
- Quickly identified the root cause of the error by inspecting the `e2b.Dockerfile`.
- Successfully resolved the issue by updating the Node.js version in the Dockerfile.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General Pattern: When encountering `EBADENGINE` errors in a containerized environment, the first place to check is the `Dockerfile` to ensure the base image has the correct Node.js version.
