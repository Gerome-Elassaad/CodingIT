TaskRef: "Fix User Team Generation on Registration"

Learnings:
- Discovered that team creation logic was being handled on the client-side in `lib/auth.ts` within the `onAuthStateChange` listener. This is an anti-pattern for critical data creation as it's unreliable and can lead to race conditions.
- The correct approach is to use a server-side database trigger to ensure atomic and reliable data creation upon user registration.
- Created a SQL function `create_user_team_on_signup` and a trigger `on_auth_user_created` to handle team creation automatically when a new user is inserted into `auth.users`.
- This server-side approach is more robust, secure, and ensures data integrity.

Difficulties:
- The file `lib/schema.ts` did not contain the expected database schema definitions, which required me to infer the table structures from the existing queries in `lib/auth.ts`. This highlights the importance of having clear and accessible schema definitions.

Successes:
- Successfully identified the root cause of the issue (client-side logic).
- Formulated and implemented a robust server-side solution using a database trigger.
- Cleaned up the client-side code by removing the redundant team creation logic.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: Critical data creation logic (like creating a user's team) should always be handled on the server-side, preferably within a database transaction or trigger, to ensure atomicity and reliability.
- Project Specifics: The project should have a clear and centralized location for database schema definitions to avoid confusion and make it easier to understand the data model.

TaskRef: "Fix typescript errors in database-diagnostics.tsx"

Learnings:
- When a function is not found, it's important to check related files to see if it exists but is not imported.
- If the function doesn't exist at all, it needs to be created. In this case, `checkEnhancedTablesExist` was created in `lib/user-settings.ts`.
- When dealing with TypeScript type mismatches, especially between an object with an index signature and a typed object, casting to `unknown` and then to the target type (`as unknown as TableStatus`) is a valid way to resolve the error when you are confident the object shape is correct at runtime.

Difficulties:
- The initial attempt to cast directly to `TableStatus` failed. The more explicit `as unknown as TableStatus` was required.

Successes:
- Successfully identified the missing function and created it in the correct location.
- Resolved the subsequent TypeScript errors by using the correct type casting.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When a function is missing, first search for it in the codebase before assuming it needs to be created.
- General pattern: For complex TypeScript casting, `as unknown as Type` is a powerful tool, but should be used with caution, ensuring the runtime object structure will match the type.
