TaskRef: "Update GitHub auth connection in integrations page (state parameter issue)"

Learnings:
- Identified that the GitHub OAuth flow was missing a `state` parameter, crucial for CSRF protection. The error "OAuth state parameter missing" (when the error URL is the application's own domain after a redirect from GitHub) strongly indicates the initial authorization request to GitHub lacked this parameter, or GitHub was configured to require it and didn't receive it.
- Implementing `state` parameter handling for a popup-based OAuth flow:
  1.  **Main Client Page (`app/settings/integrations/page.tsx`):**
      - Generate a unique `state` string before redirecting to GitHub.
      - Store this `state` temporarily (e.g., in `sessionStorage`).
      - Include this `state` in the authorization URL (`&state=...`) sent to GitHub.
  2.  **GitHub:** Redirects to the application's `redirect_uri` (`/api/github/callback`) including the `code` and the `state` as query parameters.
  3.  **Callback Handler Script (in popup - `app/api/github/callback/route.ts`):**
      - Extracts the `code` and `state` from the URL query parameters.
      - Uses `window.opener.postMessage` to send a message (e.g., type `GITHUB_AUTH_CALLBACK`) containing both the `code` and the received `state` back to the main client page.
  4.  **Main Client Page (in `handleMessage` listener):**
      - On receiving `GITHUB_AUTH_CALLBACK` message:
          - Retrieve the originally stored `state` from `sessionStorage`.
          - Compare the `state` received from the popup message with the stored `state`.
          - If they match and `code` is present, proceed to exchange the `code` for an access token by calling the backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/github/auth`).
          - If they don't match, display an error and abort.
          - Clean up the stored `state` from `sessionStorage` regardless of success or failure of validation.
- OAuth `redirect_uri` must exactly match between the client's request and the provider's settings.
- Debugging OAuth: Systematically check client ID/secret, redirect URI, scopes, state parameter, and inspect network traffic.

Difficulties:
- Initial diagnosis focused on `redirect_uri` mismatch and environment variables. While these are common OAuth issues, the specific error "OAuth state parameter missing" (on the app's domain after GitHub redirect) pointed to the `state` parameter itself.
- Understanding where the state validation should occur in a popup flow (decided on main page after popup sends code+state).

Successes:
- Successfully diagnosed the missing `state` parameter as the root cause.
- Implemented the `state` parameter handling across the frontend initiation, popup callback, and frontend message handling for validation and token exchange.
- The changes make the OAuth flow more secure by adding CSRF protection.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: Robust OAuth 2.0 `state` parameter implementation for CSRF protection.
- Debugging tip: If OAuth error occurs on *your app's domain* after redirecting from provider, and mentions "state", check if your app is correctly sending, receiving, and validating state. If error is on *provider's domain*, check initial request parameters like client_id, redirect_uri, scope.
