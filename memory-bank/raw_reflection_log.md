TaskRef: "Add theme-aware borders to announcement badges"

Learnings:
- To create theme-aware borders in a Tailwind CSS project, it's effective to use the `ring-1 ring-border` classes. The `ring-border` utility applies a color that is defined in the theme configuration, allowing it to adapt automatically to light and dark modes.
- When a component has multiple instances with slightly different styling, ensure that style updates are applied consistently across all relevant instances to maintain a uniform look and feel. In this case, one `HeroPill` had custom colors while the other used defaults, but both needed the theme-aware border.

Difficulties:
- The initial file path for `components/ui/hero-pill` was incorrect in the prompt (`components/ui/hero-pill"`), leading to a file read error. I corrected the path to `components/ui/hero-pill.tsx` based on the file list and successfully read the component.

Successes:
- Correctly identified that using a theme-based utility class (`ring-border`) was the right approach instead of adding more complex, hardcoded `dark:` variant styles. This leads to a cleaner and more maintainable implementation.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: For theme-aware styling in Tailwind CSS, prefer using theme-configured variables (like `border`, `primary`, `accent`) over hardcoding colors with `dark:` prefixes where possible.
