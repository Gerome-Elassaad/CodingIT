TaskRef: "Remove all example.com from components/auth.tsx, lib/auth.ts, app/settings/account/page.tsx"

Learnings:
- The `replace_in_file` tool requires very precise SEARCH blocks. Each SEARCH/REPLACE block only affects the *first* occurrence.
- When a `replace_in_file` operation fails, the tool provides the full current content of the file, which is crucial for correcting the SEARCH block for subsequent attempts.
- Carefully constructing SEARCH blocks by referencing the exact file content (including indentation and surrounding lines) is key to success.
- For multiple replacements in a file, multiple, ordered SEARCH/REPLACE blocks are necessary.
- Placeholder emails like "you@example.com" in input fields can be replaced with "your email".
- Placeholder/fallback emails like "user@example.com" or "john.doe@example.com" in code can be replaced with more generic placeholders like "unknown@user.com" or "your.email@yourdomain.com" depending on context.

Difficulties:
- Initial `replace_in_file` attempts failed due to imprecise SEARCH blocks or attempting to match multiple instances with a single block.
  - `components/auth.tsx`: First attempt failed due to using one SEARCH block for multiple occurrences. Corrected by using four separate, ordered blocks.
  - `lib/auth.ts`: First attempt failed, likely due to incorrect context in SEARCH blocks. Corrected by using more precise, ordered blocks based on the returned file content.
  - `app/settings/account/page.tsx`: First attempt failed because the SEARCH block included a `name` field that wasn't actually part of the state object being modified. Corrected by referencing the exact structure from the returned file content.

Successes:
- Successfully used `search_files` to locate all instances of "example.com".
- Successfully used `replace_in_file` to modify all target files after iterative refinement of SEARCH blocks.
- The process of using tool feedback (especially the returned file content on `replace_in_file` failure) was critical for success.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General pattern: When using `replace_in_file` for multiple occurrences in a single file, create distinct, ordered SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for each.
- General pattern: If `replace_in_file` fails, meticulously use the returned file content to craft the next SEARCH attempt. Pay close attention to exact line content, including whitespace and surrounding lines if necessary for uniqueness.
- General pattern: Choose context-appropriate replacements for placeholder emails (e.g., "your email" for UI placeholders, "unknown@user.com" or "your.email@yourdomain.com" for code fallbacks/defaults).
